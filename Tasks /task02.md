# Task 2: Bug Fixing – Off-by-One Error in Python

**Best Model:** Claude  
**Best Strategy:** Chain-of-Thought  

---

## Zero-Shot Prompt
```
Identify and fix the off-by-one error in the following Python function:

def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end):
        total += i
    return total
```

### ChatGPT Output (Zero-Shot)
```
def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):  # Include 'end' in the range
        total += i
    return total
```

### Claude Output (Zero-Shot)
```
def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):  # Include 'end' in the range
        total += i
    return total
```

---

## Chain-of-Thought Prompt
```
Let’s walk through this code step-by-step to find any off-by-one errors. First, observe what range(start, end) does. Then, determine whether this includes the last number in the sum. Finally, decide what change is needed.
```

### ChatGPT Output (Chain-of-Thought)
```
def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):
        total += i
    return total
```

### Claude Output (Chain-of-Thought)
```
def sum_range(start, end):
    total = 0
    for i in range(start, end + 1):  # end + 1 ensures the final number is included
        total += i
    return total
```

---

## Analysis
```
All four outputs correctly identified and fixed the bug by adjusting the range to include the `end` value. However, Claude's chain-of-thought response provided the clearest justification, explicitly explaining the behavior of Python's `range()` and the impact of `end + 1`. Therefore, the best method was Chain-of-Thought, and the best model was Claude.
