# **1. Introduction**  
This project explores **prompt engineering strategies** for AI code generation. We evaluated two language models â€” **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** and **Claude AI** â€” across 22 programming tasks using two prompting methods:

- **Zero-shot prompting**
- **Chain-of-thought prompting**

Each modelâ€™s output was assessed for accuracy, reasoning quality, and completeness. This work provides insight into how prompt style affects AI performance on real-world software development problems.

# **2. Repository Structure**

This repository contains only two files:

```
prompt-strategy-comparison/
â”œâ”€â”€ final_report.pdf       # âœ… The full comparative report
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md              # ðŸ“„ This file
```

No code execution or setup is necessary â€” all work is contained within the PDF.
