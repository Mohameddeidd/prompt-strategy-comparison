## 1. Introduction

This project explores **prompt engineering strategies for AI models** on code-related tasks. Using **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** and **Claude AI**, we compare two prompting methods — **zero-shot** and **chain-of-thought** — across **22 software engineering tasks**. This project evaluates how different prompting styles affect the quality and reasoning of AI-generated solutions.

## 2. Getting Started

This project was completed using web-based interfaces for ChatGPT (GPT-4) and Claude AI.  
All prompts, model outputs, and evaluations are compiled into a single PDF for review — no setup or code execution is required.

### 2.1 Setup

(1) Clone the repository to your workspace:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohameddeidd/prompt-strategy-comparison.git
```

(2) Navigate into the repository:  
```bash
cd prompt-strategy-comparison
```

(3) Open the final report (PDF) to view the task prompts, AI outputs, and evaluations:  
- On macOS/Linux:
```bash
open final_report.pdf
```

- On Windows (Git Bash or WSL):
```bash
start final_report.pdf
```

> The PDF includes the full comparative analysis – no code execution is needed.
