# **1. Introduction**  
This project explores **prompt engineering strategies for AI models** on code-related tasks. Using **ChatGPT (GPT-4)** and **Claude AI**, we compare two prompting methods â€” **zero-shot** and **chain-of-thought** â€” across **22 software engineering tasks**. This project evaluates how different prompting styles affect the quality and reasoning of AI-generated solutions.

# **2. Getting Started**

This project requires **Python 3.10+** and is compatible with **macOS, Linux, and Windows**. While model interaction was conducted through web interfaces (ChatGPT and Claude), outputs and evaluations are stored and compared in this repository.

## **2.1 Setup**
Got it â€” hereâ€™s that section updated so it clearly tells users how to **open the PDF** after navigating into the repository:

### âœ… Updated Section 2.1: Setup

```markdown
## **2.1 Setup**

(1) Clone the repository to your workspace:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mohameddeidd/prompt-strategy-comparison.git
```

(2) Navigate into the repository:  
```bash
cd prompt-strategy-comparison
```

(3) Open the final report (PDF) to view the task prompts, AI outputs, and evaluations:  
- On macOS/Linux, you can open it with:
  ```bash
  open final_report.pdf
  ```
- On Windows (Git Bash or WSL), you can use:
  ```bash
  start final_report.pdf
  ```

> ðŸ“„ The PDF includes the full comparative analysis â€” no code execution is needed.
```
