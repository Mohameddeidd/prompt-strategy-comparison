## GenAI for Software Development (Prompt Engineering)

This project explores the impact of **prompt engineering** on AI code generation by comparing:
- **Two Large Language Models (LLMs)**:  
  - ChatGPT (GPT-4)  
  - Claude AI  
- **Two Prompting Strategies**:  
  - Zero-shot prompting  
  - Chain-of-thought prompting  

Across **22 software engineering tasks**, we assessed outputs based on:
- Accuracy  
- Reasoning quality  
- Completeness

## Repository Structure

This repository is intentionally minimal and contains only two files:

```
prompt-strategy-comparison/
├── final_report.pdf     # ✅ The complete comparative report
└── README.md            # 📄 This file
```

No setup or scripts are needed — all work, outputs, and analysis are documented in the PDF.
